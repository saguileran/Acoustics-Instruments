## Simulation Protocol ##

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a Computational Fluid Dynamis (CFD) originated from Automata Celular Method (LGA) that was developed in 1990's by Hardy–Pomeau–de Pazzis and Frisch–Hasslacher–Pomeau.
Althought it is not recent, it has been more popularity in last decae between scientes for its wide aplications range and wasy way to parallelize.

This protocol shows one way to implement a LBM in two and three dimensions with absorbing boundaries. Fot his propuse we will use Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) with c++ and python languages.

Firs of all you
